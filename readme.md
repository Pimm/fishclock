# Fishclock

## Concept

A _fishclock_ is an analog clock that is slightly different from its _human_ siblings. The origin of the hands moves, causing the minute hand to be observed with more accuracy.

This is a human clock. The minute hand shows that it is roughly a _quarter to_. The hour hand indicates which quarter to that is. Quarter to one, in this case. Only twelve quarter to's exist, so the exact angle of the hour hand does not matter. The angle of the minute hand is important, though.

This is a fishclock which represents the same time. The origin of both hands has moved, making the minute hand longer. The angle of longer hands can be more accurately read, and the movement of longer hands is easier to notice.

This is another human clock. It represents roughly half nine.

This is a fishclock which represents the same time. As with the fishclock above, the origin of both hands has moved in the opposite direction of the minute hand.
